# comp524-assignments
Stuff I programmed for COMP 524 during the Spring 2021 semester. 

## Assignment 1
Just a bunch of functions I needed to make, to get used to Racket.

## Assignment 2
Big step up from assignment 1. We were asked to make a lexer for a simple language. 

## Assignment 3
Parsing the lexed code from assignment 2 to produce a parse tree.

## Assignment 5
Evaluating the parse tree from assignment 3.
